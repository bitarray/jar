  Genesis Protocol — Scoring & Reward Computation

  Scoring is based on rankings of past commits + the current PR.

  Flow:
  1. PR opened → bot selects N comparison targets from hash(prId)
  2. Reviewers rank all N+1 commits (targets + current PR) on 3 dimensions
  3. Reviewers submit detailed comments + merge verdict
  4. Other reviewers meta-review (thumbs up/down) to filter bad reviews
  5. Bot merges when >50% weighted merge votes (or founder override)
  6. Bot records rankings + meta-reviews in the signed merge commit
  7. Spec validates targets, filters reviews by meta-review, derives
     score using weighted lower-quantile

  See Design.lean for deferred features.

/-! ### Comparison Target Selection -/

/-- Maps a PR ID to a pseudo-random natural number for target selection. -/
def prIdHash (prId : PRId) : Nat :=
  let a := 2654435761
  (prId * a) % (2^32)

/-- Select comparison targets from past scored commits.
    Only commits merged before prCreatedAt are eligible.
    Divides eligible commits into buckets, picks one per bucket using hash(prId). -/
def selectComparisonTargets
    (scoredCommits : List (CommitId × Epoch))
    (numTargets : Nat)
    (prId : PRId)
    (prCreatedAt : Epoch) : List CommitId :=
  let eligible := scoredCommits.filter (fun (_, epoch) => epoch < prCreatedAt)
  let pastCommitIds := eligible.map (·.1)
  let n := pastCommitIds.length
  if n == 0 then []
  else
    let k := min numTargets n
    let hash := prIdHash prId
    List.range k |>.map fun i =>
      let bucketStart := n * i / k
      let bucketEnd := n * (i + 1) / k
      let bucketSize := bucketEnd - bucketStart
      if bucketSize == 0 then
        pastCommitIds[bucketStart]!
      else
        let idx := bucketStart + (hash + i * 7) % bucketSize
        pastCommitIds[idx]!

/-- Validate comparison targets in a signed commit. -/
def validateComparisonTargets [gv : GenesisVariant]
    (commit : SignedCommit)
    (scoredCommits : List (CommitId × Epoch)) : Bool :=
  let eligible := scoredCommits.filter (fun (_, epoch) => epoch < commit.prCreatedAt)
  if eligible.isEmpty then commit.comparisonTargets.isEmpty
  else
    let expected := selectComparisonTargets scoredCommits
      (min gv.rankingSize eligible.length) commit.prId commit.prCreatedAt
    commit.comparisonTargets == expected

/-! ### Meta-Review Filtering

  Reviews are filtered by meta-reviews (thumbs up/down) before scoring.
  A review is excluded if its net meta-review weight is negative
  (more weighted thumbs-down than thumbs-up).
-/

/-- Compute net meta-review weight for a specific reviewer's review.
    Positive = approved, negative = rejected, zero = no meta-reviews. -/
def metaReviewNet
    (metaReviews : List MetaReview)
    (targetReviewer : ContributorId)
    (getWeight : ContributorId → Nat) : Int :=
  metaReviews.foldl (fun acc (mr : MetaReview) =>
    if mr.targetReviewer == targetReviewer then
      let w := (getWeight mr.metaReviewer : Int)
      if mr.approve then acc + w else acc - w
    else acc
  ) 0

/-- Filter reviews: keep only those with non-negative meta-review net weight.
    Reviews with no meta-reviews are kept (net = 0). -/
def filterReviews
    (reviews : List EmbeddedReview)
    (metaReviews : List MetaReview)
    (getWeight : ContributorId → Nat) : List EmbeddedReview :=
  reviews.filter fun (r : EmbeddedReview) =>
    metaReviewNet metaReviews r.reviewer getWeight ≥ 0

/-! ### Score Derivation from Rankings

  Each reviewer ranks N+1 commits (targets + current PR).
  The score for each dimension is the PR's percentile rank (0-100)
  among the ranked items. Rank 1 of N = 100, rank N of N = 0.

  This is independent of past scores — purely positional. The score
  is always 0-100, making weightDelta predictable and extensible.
-/

/-- Compute the percentile rank (0-100) of the current PR in a ranking.
    Ranking is best-to-worst. Position 0 (first) = 100, last = 0.
    If the PR is not in the ranking, returns 0. -/
def percentileFromRanking
    (ranking : Ranking)
    (currentPR : CommitId) : Nat :=
  let n := ranking.length
  if n ≤ 1 then 100  -- sole item gets 100
  else
    match ranking.findIdx? (· == currentPR) with
    | none => 0
    | some pos => (n - 1 - pos) * 100 / (n - 1)

/-- percentileFromRanking always returns a value ≤ 100. -/
theorem percentileFromRanking_le_100 (ranking : Ranking) (pr : CommitId) :
    percentileFromRanking ranking pr ≤ 100 := by
  simp only [percentileFromRanking]
  split <;> rename_i h
  · -- n ≤ 1: returns 100

  · -- n > 1: match on findIdx?
    split
    · -- none: returns 0
      omega
    · -- some pos: (n - 1 - pos) * 100 / (n - 1) ≤ 100
      rename_i pos _
      apply Nat.div_le_of_le_mul
      exact Nat.mul_le_mul_right 100 (Nat.sub_le ..)

/-- Derive a score for the current PR from one reviewer's rankings.
    Each dimension is a percentile rank (0-100). -/

    (review : EmbeddedReview)
    (currentPR : CommitId) : CommitScore :=
  { difficulty := percentileFromRanking review.difficultyRanking currentPR,
    novelty := percentileFromRanking review.noveltyRanking currentPR,
    designQuality := percentileFromRanking review.designQualityRanking currentPR }

/-! ### Weighted Lower-Quantile

  The score at the configured quantile of the weighted distribution.
  With quantile = 1/3: the value where 1/3 of weight is below.
  Sybil inflation scores sit at the top and are ignored.
  Safe up to 66% honest for inflation; meta-review covers deflation.
-/

/-- Weighted quantile of a list of (weight, value) pairs.
    Returns the value at the point where `quantileNum/quantileDen`
    of the total weight has been accumulated (walking from low to high). -/

    (qNum : Nat := gv.quantileNum) (qDen : Nat := gv.quantileDen) : Nat :=
  if entries.isEmpty then 0

    let sorted := entries.toArray.qsort (fun a b => a.2 < b.2) |>.toList
    let totalWeight := sorted.foldl (fun acc (w, _) => acc + w) 0
    if totalWeight == 0 then 0
    else
      -- Target: first value where cumulative weight ≥ totalWeight * qNum / qDen

        let newCum := cumWeight + w
        if cumWeight ≤ target then (newCum, v) else (newCum, best)
      ) (0, sorted.head!.2)
      result

/-- Derive a score for the current PR from all approved reviews.

    For each reviewer, compute the percentile score from their rankings.
    Then take the weighted quantile across all reviewers per dimension.

/-! ### Score Computation -/

/-- Compute the score for a single signed commit.

    Steps:
    1. Validate comparison targets against hash(prId).
    2. Filter reviews by meta-review (exclude thumbed-down reviews).
    3. Check minimum approved reviews from weighted reviewers.
    4. Derive score from rankings using weighted lower-quantile.

    Returns the CommitScore (percentile-based, 0-100 per dimension).
    Reward computation is deferred to finalization (see Design.lean). -/
